To run the program you must initate 1 instance of our bootstrap server
go run bootServer/main.go

Note all nodes need to be ran from different Terminals
Now you need to initate a number of nodes
go run Node/main.go

This will request a port in the terminal.
Anyport developer port you have acces to is valid (EXCEPT 50051!)
As this port is used by our bootStrap Server

From there all relevant info will be printed in the Terminal
